# Designing a UI for Complex Sorting Tasks


## Aims of this project
The aim of this project is to construct a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is accessible to users who have little to no experience with collaborative robots. The extent to which we have succeeded in creating such a system will be evaluated via the use of sorting tasks as a vehicle to test if our implementation is sound.



## GUI
The GUI has been implemented using [`python 2.7`] and its corresponding [`TkInter`] package.
