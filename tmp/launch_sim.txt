//SHELL 1 where the simulation is hosted

cd ~/ros_ws1
./intera.sh sim  //sim can be any name that we want for the simulation name
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make // DONT NEED THIS
roslaunch sawyer_gazebo sawyer_world.launch  // This launches the gazebo simulation

roslaunch sawyer_gazebo sawyer_world.launch electric_gripper:=true // Use this to launch sawyer with the gripper

// If exit code 255 is emitted, disconnect (ctrl+d) SHELL 2 and do > killall gzserver and > killall gzclient, then restart the sim with (./intera.sh sim) and relaunch the world (SHELL 1)

// SHELL 2 where we will use rosrun to deploy scripts to sawyer
cd ~/catkin_ws //idk why but this worked DONT NEED THIS
cd ~/ros_ws1$
./intera.sh sim // sim is whatever name we gave the simulation in shell 1
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun intera_examples <file.py> // the usual
